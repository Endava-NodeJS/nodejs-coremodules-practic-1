### File uploading

In this leasson we'll learn how to implement uploading file to api on NodeJS. It will be based on the previously created API (notes CRUD + Auth + DB).

#### Hereâ€™s what we have to implement during that session:
 - Create PUT /user update endpoint, endpoint should update only own user, and not be available to call for quest(not signin users) user

 - Created PUT /user updation endpoint should have ability to upload avatar allowing (JPEG/JPG) formats

To test the implementation you have to make PUT /user update endpoing to be authorized
